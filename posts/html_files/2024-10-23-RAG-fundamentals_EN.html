<p>To get it for free, instead of using an OpenAI account (as you will see in most tutorials), we are going to use the <code>API inference</code> from Hugging Face, which has a free tier of 1000 requests per day, which is more than enough to make this post.</p>

<p>To use the HuggingFace <code>API Inference</code>, the first thing you need is to have a HuggingFace account. Once you have one, go to <a href="https://huggingface.co/settings/keys">Access tokens</a> in your profile settings and generate a new token.
We need to give it a name, in my case I will name it <code>rag-fundamentals</code> and enable the permission <code>Make calls to serverless Inference API</code>. A token will be created that we need to copy.</p>

</section>
<section class="section-block-markdown-cell">
<p><code>RAG</code> stands for <code>Retrieval Augmented Generation</code>, a technique created to obtain information from documents. Although LLMs can become very powerful and hold a lot of knowledge, they will never be able to answer questions about private documents, such as company reports, internal documentation, etc. That is why <code>RAG</code> was created, to be able to use these LLMs on such private documentation.
<img alt="What is RAG?" src="https://pub-fb664c455eca46a2ba762a065ac900f7.r2.dev/RAG.webp"/></p>
</section>
<section class="section-block-markdown-cell">
<p>The idea is that a user asks a question about that private documentation, the system is able to retrieve the part of the documentation where the answer to that question is, the question and the part of the documentation are passed to a LLM and the LLM generates the answer for the user.</p>
</section>
<section class="section-block-markdown-cell">
<h3 id="How-is-information-stored?">How is information stored?<a class="anchor-link" href="#How-is-information-stored?">¶</a></h3>
</section>
<section class="section-block-markdown-cell">
<p>It is well known, and if you didn't know, I'll tell you now, that LLMs have a limit to the amount of information that can be inputted, which is called the context window. This is due to the internal architectures of the LLMs, which is not relevant right now. But the important thing is that you can't just pass a document and a question to them, because it's likely that the LLM will not be able to process all that information.
In cases where more information is typically passed than what its context window allows, what usually happens is that the LLM does not pay attention to the end of the input. Imagine you ask the LLM about something in your document, that this information is at the end of the document and the LLM does not read it.
Therefore, what is done is to divide the documentation into blocks called <code>chunks</code>. So the documentation is stored in a bunch of <code>chunks</code>, which are pieces of that documentation. So when the user asks a question, the <code>chunk</code> containing the answer to that question is passed to the LLM.
In addition to splitting the documentation into <code>chunk</code>s, these are converted into embeddings, which are numerical representations of the <code>chunk</code>s. This is because LLMs do not actually understand text, but rather numbers, and the <code>chunk</code>s are converted into numbers so that the LLM can understand them. If you want to understand more about embeddings, you can read my post on <a href="https://www.maximofn.com/transformers">transformers</a> where I explain how transformers work, which is the architecture underlying the LLMs. You can also read my post on <a href="https://www.maximofn.com/chromadb">ChromaDB</a> where I explain how embeddings are stored in a vector database. Additionally, it would be interesting for you to read my post on the <a href="https://www.maximofn.com/hugging-face-tokenizers">HuggingFace Tokenizers</a> library, where it is explained how text is tokenized, which is the step prior to generating embeddings.

<p>We have said that the documentation is divided into <code>chunks</code> and the <code>chunk</code> containing the answer to the user's question is passed to the LLM. But, how do we know in which <code>chunk</code> the answer is? For this, what is done is converting the user's question to an embedding, and the similarity between the embedding of the question and the embeddings of the <code>chunks</code> is calculated. Thus, the <code>chunk</code> with the highest similarity is the one that is passed to the LLM.

<p>The <code>sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2</code> model has only 22M parameters, so you will be able to run it on any GPU. Even if you do not have a GPU, you will be able to run it on a CPU.</p>

<p>The LLM we are going to use to generate the responses, which is <code>Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct</code>, as its name indicates, is a model with 72B parameters, so this model cannot be run on any GPU and on a CPU it is unthinkable due to how slow it would be. Therefore, we will use this LLM via the API, but when generating the embeddings, we can do it locally without any problem.</p>

<p>As we can see, there are 3611 <code>chunks</code>. Since the daily limit of the Hugging Face API is 1000 calls on the free account, if we want to create embeddings for all the <code>chunks</code>, we would run out of available calls and also wouldn't be able to create embeddings for all the <code>chunks</code>.</p>
</section>
<section class="section-block-markdown-cell">
<p>We remind you once again, this embedding model is very small, only 22M parameters, so it can run on almost any computer, faster or slower, but it can run.</p>
</section>
<section class="section-block-markdown-cell">
<p>Since we are only going to create the embeddings of the <code>chunk</code>s once, even if we don't have a very powerful computer and it takes a long time, it will only be executed once. Then, when we want to ask questions about the documentation, we will generate the embeddings of the prompt with the Hugging Face API and use the LLM with the API. Therefore, we will only have to go through the process of generating the embeddings of the <code>chunk</code>s once.</p>

<pre>Neeva, a cloud-native, ad-free search engine founded in 2019, has leveraged Karpenter and Amazon EC2 Spot Instances to significantly improve its infrastructure management and cost optimization. Here’s how:

### Early Collaboration with Karpenter
In late 2021, Neeva began working closely with the Karpenter team, experimenting with and contributing fixes to an early version of Karpenter. This collaboration allowed Neeva to integrate Karpenter with its Kubernetes dashboard, enabling the company to gather valuable metrics on usage and performance.

### Combining Spot Instances and On-Demand Instances
Neeva runs its jobs on a large scale, which can lead to significant costs. To manage these costs effectively, the company adopted a combination of Amazon EC2 Spot Instances and On-Demand Instances. Spot Instances allow Neeva to bid on unused EC2 capacity, often at a fraction of the On-Demand price, while On-Demand Instances provide the necessary reliability for critical pipelines.

### Flexibility and Instance Diversification
According to Mohit Agarwal, infrastructure engineering lead at Neeva, Karpenter's adoption of best practices for Spot Instances, including flexibility and instance diversification, has been crucial. This approach ensures that Neeva can dynamically adjust its compute resources to meet varying workloads while minimizing costs.

### Improved Scalability and Agility
By using Karpenter to provision infrastructure resources for its Amazon EKS clusters, Neeva has achieved several key benefits:
- **Scalability**: Neeva can scale its compute resources up or down as needed, ensuring that it always has the necessary capacity to handle its workloads.
- **Agility**: The company can iterate quickly and democratize infrastructure changes, reducing the time spent on systems administration by up to 100 hours per week.

### Enhanced Development Cycles
The integration of Karpenter and Spot Instances has also accelerated Neeva's development cycles. The company can now launch new features and improvements more rapidly, which is essential for maintaining a competitive edge in the search engine market.

### Cost Savings and Budget Control
Using Spot Instances, Neeva has been able to stay within its budget while meeting its performance requirements. This cost optimization is critical for a company that prioritizes user-first experiences and has no competing incentives from advertising.

### Future Plans
Neeva is committed to continuing its innovation and expansion. The company plans to launch in new regions and further improve its search engine, all while maintaining cost efficiency. As Mohit Agarwal notes, "The bulk of our compute is or will be managed using Karpenter going forward."

### Conclusion
By leveraging Karpenter and Amazon EC2 Spot Instances, Neeva has not only optimized its infrastructure costs but also enhanced its scalability, agility, and development speed. This strategic approach has positioned Neeva to deliver high-quality, ad-free search experiences to its users while maintaining a strong focus on cost control and innovation.

<section class="section-block-markdown-cell">
<p>When I asked the LLM to generate a question about the document, I also asked it to generate the correct answer. This is the answer the LLM gave me.</p>
<pre><code>```Neeva used Karpenter and Amazon EC2 Spot Instances to improve its infrastructure management and cost optimization in several ways:
Gestión Simplificada de Instancias:
Karpenter: By adopting Karpenter, Neeva simplified the process of provisioning and managing compute resources for its Amazon EKS clusters. Karpenter automatically provisions and de-provisions instances based on the workload, eliminating the need for manual configurations and reducing the complexity of understanding different compute instances.Spot Instances: Neeva leveraged Amazon EC2 Spot Instances, which are unused EC2 capacity available at a significant discount (up to 90% cost savings). This allowed the company to control costs while meeting its performance requirements.Escalabilidad mejorada:
Karpenter: La capacidad de Karpenter para escalar recursos dinámicamente permitió a Neeva activar nuevas instancias rápidamente, permitiendo a la empresa iterar a una mayor velocidad y realizar más experimentos en menos tiempo.Instancias Spot: El uso de Instancias Spot proporcionó flexibilidad y diversificación de instancias, facilitando que Neeva escale sus recursos de cómputo de manera eficiente.Mejorando la Productividad:
Karpenter: By democratizing infrastructure changes, Karpenter allowed any engineer to modify Kubernetes configurations, reducing the dependency on specialized expertise. This saved the Neeva team up to 100 hours per week of wait time on systems administration.Instancias Spot: La capacidad de aprovisionar y desaprovisionar rápidamente instancias Spot redujo los retrasos en el pipeline de desarrollo, asegurando que los trabajos no quedaran atascados debido a la falta de recursos disponibles.Costo-eficiencia:
Karpenter: Karpenter's best practices for Spot Instances, including flexibility and instance diversification, helped Neeva use these instances more effectively, staying within budget.Instancias Spot: Los ahorros de costos de utilizar Instancias Spot permitieron a Neeva ejecutar trabajos a gran escala, como la indexación, por casi el mismo costo pero en una fracción del tiempo. Por ejemplo, Neeva redujo sus trabajos de indexación de 18 horas a solo 3 horas.Mejor Utilización de Recursos:
Karpenter: Karpenter provided better visibility into compute resource usage, allowing Neeva to track and optimize its resource consumption more closely.Instancias Spot: La combinación de Karpenter e Instancias Spot permitió a Neeva ejecutar grandes modelos de lenguaje de manera más eficiente, mejorando la experiencia de búsqueda para sus usuarios.In summary, Neeva's adoption of Karpenter and Amazon EC2 Spot Instances significantly improved its infrastructure management, cost optimization, and overall development efficiency, enabling the company to deliver better ad-free search experiences to its users.```
And this has been the response generated by our `RAG`
Neeva, un motor de búsqueda nativo en la nube y sin anuncios fundado en 2019, ha aprovechado Karpenter y las Instancias Spot de Amazon EC2 para mejorar significativamente su gestión de infraestructura y optimización de costos. Así es cómo:
### Colaboración temprana con KarpenterIn late 2021, Neeva began working closely with the Karpenter team, experimenting with and contributing fixes to an early version of Karpenter. This collaboration allowed Neeva to integrate Karpenter with its Kubernetes dashboard, enabling the company to gather valuable metrics on usage and performance.
