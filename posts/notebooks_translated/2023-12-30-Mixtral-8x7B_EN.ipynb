The first two days after the release of `gemini` there was a lot of talk about that model, but as soon as `mixtral-8x7b` was released, `gemini` was completely forgotten and the whole community was talking about `mixtral-8x7b`.\n",

In the above image only four `Feed forward` layers are shown, I suppose this is to simplify the diagram, but in reality there are 8 `Feed forward` layers. You can also see two paths for two different words, the word `More` and the word `Parameters` and how the router chooses which `Feed forward` to use for each word."
