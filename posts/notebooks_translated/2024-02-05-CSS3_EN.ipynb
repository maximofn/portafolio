"In CSS there are 3 main parts:\n",
"\n",
"- Selector**: This is the part that selects the element to which the style will be applied.\n",
"- Property**: This is the part that defines the style to be applied to the element.\n",
"- Value**: It is the part that defines the value of the property to be applied to the element.\n",

"To add comments in CSS you use `/* comment */`.\n",

      "There are several types of selectors:\n",
"\n",
"- Universal selector**: Selects all elements on the page. The asterisk `*` is used.\n",
"- Type selector**: Selects all elements of a type. The name of the element type is used. For example, `p` selects all paragraphs.\n",
"- Class selector**: Selects all elements that have a class. The class name is used. For example, `.class` selects all the elements that have the class `class`. This is useful, because if we want all the buttons to be the same, in the html we put `<button class=\"boton\">` and in the css we put `.boton { /* styles */ }`. This way all the buttons will have the same styles, and we want a button to be different, we put another class.\n",
"- Pseudo-class selector**: Selects all elements that have a pseudo-class. The name of the pseudo-class is used. For example, `:hover` selects all elements that are being selected by the mouse. This is useful, because if we want a button to change color when the mouse is over it, in the css we put `.boton:hover { /* styles */ }`. This way the button will have the styles that we want when the mouse is over it. Some pseudo-classes are:\n",
"    - `:hover`: Selects all elements that are being selected by the mouse.\n",
"    - active`: Selects all elements that are being selected by the mouse and are being clicked.\n",
"    - `:focus`: Selects all elements that are being selected by the mouse and are being clicked, and also have the focus.\n",
"    - `:first-child`: Selects all elements that are the first child of their parent. This is useful for example with the `<li>` of the lists, because if we want that the first element of the list has a different style, in the css we put `li:first-child { /* styles */ }`. This way the first element of the list will have the styles that we want.\n",
"    - `:last-child`: Selects all elements that are the last child of their parent. This is useful for example with the `<li>` of the lists, because if we want that the last element of the list has a different style, in the css we put `li:last-child { /* styles */ }`. This way the last element of the list will have the styles that we want.\n",
"    - `:nth-child(n)`: Selects all elements that are the nth child of their parent. For example, `:nth-child(2)` selects all elements that are the second child of their parent.\n",
"    - `:nth-last-child(n)`: Selects all elements that are the nth child of their parent, starting from the end. For example, `:nth-last-child(2)` selects all elements that are the second child of their parent, starting from the end.\n",
"    - `:nth-of-type(n)`: Selects all elements that are the nth child of their parent, of the same type. For example, `:nth-of-type(2)` selects all elements that are the second child of their parent, of the same type.\n",
"    - `:nth-last-of-type(n)`: Selects all elements that are the nth child of their parent, of the same type, starting from the end. For example, `:nth-last-of-type(2)` selects all elements that are the second child of their parent, of the same type, starting from the end.\n",
"    - `:first-of-type`: Selects all elements that are the first child of their parent, of the same type.\n",
"    - `:last-of-type`: Selects all elements that are the last child of their parent, of the same type.\n",
"    - `:only-child`: Selects all elements that are the only child of their parent.\n",
"    - `:only-of-type`: Selects all elements that are the only child of their parent, of the same type.\n",
"    - `:empty`: Se\n",
"- id selector**: Select an element that has an id. The id name is used. For example, `#id` selects the element that has the id `id`. This is useful, because if we want an element to be unique, in the html we put `<p id=\"unique\">` and in the css we put `#unique { /* styles */ }`. This way that element will have the styles that we want, and if we want another element to be the same, we put another class.\n",
"- Combined selectors**: Select elements that meet several conditions. We use the selectors that we want, separated by a space. For example, `p .class` selects all the elements that have the class `class` and are children of a paragraph. This is useful, because if we want that all the buttons that are inside a paragraph are equal, in the html we put `<p class=\"parrafo_que_que_quiero_cambiar\"><button class=\"boton\">` and in the css we put `.parrafo_que_quiero_cambiar .boton { /* estilos */ }`. Thus all the buttons that are inside a paragraph with the class `paragraph_that_I_want_to_change` will have the same styles, and we want a button to be different, we put another class.\n",
"- First level combined selector**: Select elements that meet several conditions, but only if they are in the first level. We use the selectors that we want, separated by a `>`. For example, `p > .class` selects all elements that have the class `class` and are direct children of a paragraph. This is useful, because if we want all the buttons inside a paragraph to be the same, in the html we put `<p class=\"paragraph_that_we_want_to_change\"><button class=\"button\">`` and in the css we put `.paragraph_that_we_want_to_change > .button { /* styles */ }`. Thus all the buttons that are inside a paragraph with the class `.paragraph_that_I_want_to_change` will have the same styles, and we want a button to be different, we put another class.\n",
"- Combined sibling selector**: Select elements that meet several conditions, but only if they are at the same level. You use as many selectors as you want, separated by a `~`. For example, `p ~ .class` selects all elements that have the class `class` and are at the same level as a paragraph. This is useful, because if we want all the buttons that are at the same level as a paragraph to be the same, in the html we put `<p class=\"paragraph_that_we_want_to_change\"></p><button class=\"button\">`` and in the css we put `.paragraph_that_we_want_to_change ~ .button { /* styles */ }`. Thus all the buttons that are at the same level as a paragraph with the class `.paragraph_that_I_want_to_change` will have the same styles, and we want a button to be different, we put another class.\n",
"- Combined adjacent sibling selector**: Select elements that meet several conditions, but only if they are at the same level and are adjacent. You use as many selectors as you want, separated by a `+`. For example, `p + .class` selects all elements that have the class `class` and are at the same level and adjacent to a paragraph. This is useful, because if we want all buttons that are at the same level and adjacent to a paragraph to be the same, in the html we put `<p class=\"paragraph_that_I_want_to_change\"></p><button class=\"button\">` and in the css we put `.paragraph_that_I_want_to_change + .button { /* styles */ }`. Thus all the buttons that are on the same level and are adjacent to a paragraph with the class `.paragraph_that_I_want_to_change` will have the same styles, and we want a button to be different, we put another class.\n",
"\n",
"The normal thing is to use the class selector, because this way we can reuse the styles."

You can find transparency in a legacy form with `rgba(255, 0, 0, 0, 0.5)`, which is red with 50% transparency, but it is best to use the modern form.\n",

"- HSL**: You can set the color in HSL. For example, `hsl(0, 100%, 50%)` is red.\n",
