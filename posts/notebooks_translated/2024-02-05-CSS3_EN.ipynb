        "- **Class selector**: Selects all elements that have a class. It uses the class name. For example, `.class` selects all elements that have the class `class`. This is useful because if we want all buttons to be the same, in the HTML we put `<button class=\"button\">` and in the CSS we put `.button { /* styles */ }`. This way all buttons will have the same styles, and if we want a button to be different, we assign it another class.",
        "- **Pseudo-class selector**: Selects all elements that have a pseudo-class. The name of the pseudo-class is used. For example, `:hover` selects all elements that are being hovered by the mouse. This is useful because if we want a button to change color when the mouse is over it, in the CSS we put `.button:hover { /* styles */ }`. This way, the button will have the styles we want when the mouse is over it. Some pseudo-classes are:",

        "- `:active`: Selects all elements that are being selected by the mouse and are being pressed.",
        "- `:focus`: Selects all elements that are being selected by the mouse and are being pressed, and also have focus.",
        "- `:first-child`: Selects all elements that are the first child of their parent. This is useful for example with the `<li>` in lists, because if we want the first element of the list to have a different style, in the css we put `li:first-child { /* styles */ }`. This way, the first element of the list will have the styles we want.",
        "- `:last-child`: Selects all elements that are the last child of their parent. This is useful, for example, with the `<li>` in lists because if we want the last element of the list to have a different style, in the CSS we put `li:last-child { /* styles */ }`. This way, the last element of the list will have the styles we want.",
        "- `:nth-child(n)`: Selects all elements that are the nth child of their parent. For example, `:nth-child(2)` selects all elements that are the second child of their parent.",

        "- **ID Selector**: Selects an element that has an id. The id name is used. For example, `#id` selects the element that has the id `id`. This is useful because if we want an element to be unique, in the HTML we put `<p id=\"unique\">` and in the CSS we put `#unique { /* styles */ }`. That way, that element will have the styles we want, and if we want another element to be the same, we give it a different class.",
        "- **Combined Selectors**: They select elements that meet several conditions. We use the selectors we want, separated by a space. For example, `p .class` selects all elements that have the class `class` and are children of a paragraph. This is useful because if we want all buttons that are inside a paragraph to be the same, in the HTML we write `<p class=\"paragraph_to_change\"><button class=\"button\">` and in the CSS we write `.paragraph_to_change .button { /* styles */ }`. That way, all buttons that are inside a paragraph with the class `paragraph_to_change` will have the same styles, and if we want a button to be different, we give it another class.",
        "- **Direct child combinator selector**: These selectors select elements that fulfill several conditions, but only if they are at the first level. We use the selectors we want, separated by a `>`. For example, `p > .class` selects all elements that have the class `class` and are direct children of a paragraph. This is useful because if we want all the buttons inside a paragraph to be the same, in the HTML we write `<p class=\"paragraph_to_change\"><button class=\"button\">` and in the CSS we write `.paragraph_to_change > .button { /* styles */ }`. Thus, all the buttons inside a paragraph with the class `paragraph_to_change` will have the same styles, and if we want a button to be different, we assign it another class.",
        "- **Combined Sibling Selector**: Select elements that meet several conditions, but only if they are at the same level. We use the selectors we want, separated by a `~`. For example, `p ~ .class` selects all elements that have the class `class` and are at the same level as a paragraph. This is useful because if we want all the buttons at the same level as a paragraph to be the same, in the HTML we put `<p class=\"paragraph_i_want_to_change\"></p><button class=\"button\">` and in the CSS we put `.paragraph_i_want_to_change ~ .button { /* styles */ }`. That way, all the buttons that are at the same level as a paragraph with the class `paragraph_i_want_to_change` will have the same styles, and if we want a button to be different, we assign it another class.",
        "- **Adjacent Sibling Combinator Selector**: Select elements that meet several conditions, but only if they are on the same level and are adjacent. We use the selectors we want, separated by a `+`. For example, `p + .class` selects all elements that have the class `class` and are on the same level and adjacent to a paragraph. This is useful because if we want all buttons that are on the same level and adjacent to a paragraph to be the same, in the HTML we put `<p class=\"paragraph_I_want_to_change\"></p><button class=\"button\">` and in the CSS we put `.paragraph_I_want_to_change + .button { /* styles */ }`. Thus, all buttons that are on the same level and adjacent to a paragraph with the class `paragraph_I_want_to_change` will have the same styles, and if we want a button to be different, we assign it another class.",

Quantum theory explains the nature and behavior of energy and matter on the quantum (atomic and subatomic) level.\n\n## What is a Quantum Computer?\n\nA quantum computer uses quantum bits or qubits. Unlike a classical bit that must be either 0 or 1, a qubit can be both 0 and 1 at the same time, thanks to a phenomenon called superposition. This enables quantum computers to process a massive amount of data simultaneously.\n\n## Advantages of Quantum Computing\n\n1. **Speed**: Quantum computers can solve certain problems much faster than classical computers.\n2. **Power**: They can simulate systems that are too complex for classical computers.\n3. **Efficiency**: Quantum algorithms can reduce the resources needed for solving complex problems.\n\n## Challenges in Quantum Computing\n\nDespite its potential, quantum computing faces significant challenges:\n\n- **Decoherence**: Quantum states are fragile and can be easily disturbed by their environment, leading to loss of information.\n- **Error Rates**: Quantum operations have higher error rates compared to classical ones.\n- **Scalability**: Building large-scale quantum computers is currently a massive engineering challenge.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nThough still in its infancy, quantum computing holds the promise of revolutionizing the way we solve complex problems. Continuous research and development are required to overcome the current challenges and unlock the full potential of quantum computing.\n```",

Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax, which makes it easy to read and write. \n\n## Table of Contents\n\n1. Headers\n2. Emphasis\n3. Lists\n4. Links\n5. Images\n6. Code\n\n## Headers\n\nHeaders are used to create a hierarchical structure in your documents. Markdown supports six levels of headers, from `# Header 1` to `###### Header 6`.\n\n## Emphasis\n\nYou can add emphasis to your text by using asterisks (`*`) or underscores (`_`). For italic text, wrap the text in one asterisk or underscore. For bold text, wrap the text in two asterisks or underscores.\n\n## Lists\n\nMarkdown supports ordered and unordered lists. Ordered lists use numbers followed by periods, while unordered lists use asterisks, plus signs, or hyphens.\n\n## Links\n\nTo create a hyperlink, enclose the link text in brackets (`[]`), and then follow it immediately with the URL in parentheses (`()`).\n\n## Images\n\nImages are similar to links, but they start with an exclamation mark (`!`). Enclose the alt text in brackets, and then follow it immediately with the image URL in parentheses.\n\n## Code\n\nTo include inline code, wrap the code in backticks (`` ` ``). For code blocks, use three backticks on separate lines before and after the code block.\n```",

Examples of how a surface plot looks in the Python programming language are shown in this showcase page.\n\nA lot of people use Plotly due to its functionalities. You are able to use it with many programming languages and tools like MATLAB, Python, R, Perl, Julia, Arduino, and REST among others. The company behind this library is also named Plotly and its main product is Plotly. Do not get confused, though: there are many companies working on graphs and data visualization tools.\n\nPlotly is the core library that enables the creation of interactive and versatile graphs, which can be used in many publications and tools. The library is available for different languages, making it very popular in a lot of industries including finance, government, and academia.\n\n## Plotly in Python\n\nBesides using Plotly as an online service, it can also be used offline. To do this, we only need to install Plotly for Python and I'm going to explain how.\n\n```python\n# First we need to install Plotly\npip install plotly\n```\n\n\n```python\n# Import the library to be used\nimport plotly.express as px\n\n# Create a simple graph\nfig = px.line(x=[\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"], y=[1, 3, 2], title=\"Sample Graph\")\n\n# Show the graph\nfig.show()\n```\n\nThis Python script shows a simple graph with the x-values as `[\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"]` and y-values as `[1, 3, 2]`. The graph will be displayed in your default web browser.\n\nPlotly also has a lot of other functionalities for creating different types of plots like bar charts, scatter plots, histograms, heatmaps, and much more. You can refer to Plotly's official [documentation](https://plotly.com/python/) for more information.\n```",

One of the significant branches of AI is machine learning (ML), which focuses on enabling machines to learn from data and improve their performance over time.\n\n## What is Machine Learning?\n\nMachine learning is a subset of AI that involves training algorithms to make predictions or decisions based on data. These algorithms can identify patterns and relationships within large datasets, enabling computers to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence.\n\n### Types of Machine Learning\n\nThere are several types of machine learning, including:\n\n1. **Supervised Learning**: The algorithm is trained on a labeled dataset, which means that each training example is paired with an output label. The goal is to learn a mapping from inputs to outputs.\n2. **Unsupervised Learning**: The algorithm is given a dataset without labeled responses and must find hidden patterns or structures in the data.\n3. **Reinforcement Learning**: The algorithm learns by interacting with an environment, receiving rewards or penalties based on its actions, and aims to maximize the cumulative reward.\n\n## Applications of Machine Learning\n\nMachine learning has a wide range of applications, including:\n\n- **Healthcare**: Predicting disease outbreaks, personalizing treatment plans, and improving diagnostic accuracy.\n- **Finance**: Fraud detection, risk assessment, and algorithmic trading.\n- **Marketing**: Customer segmentation, recommendation engines, and sentiment analysis.\n- **Transport**: Self-driving cars, route optimization, and predictive maintenance.\n\nBy leveraging machine learning, organizations can make data-driven decisions, streamline operations, and enhance their services.\n```",

In this tutorial, we will cover the basics of Python, including syntax, variables, and data types.\n\n### Syntax\n\nPython syntax is designed to be readable and straightforward. Here is an example of a simple Python program:\n\n```python\n# This is a single line comment\n\n\"\"\"\nThis is a multi-line comment\n\"\"\"\n\n# Print \"Hello, World!\" to the console\nprint(\"Hello, World!\")\n```\n\n### Variables\n\nVariables in Python can store different types of data and do not require explicit declaration of their type.\n\n```python\n# Integer variable\nx = 5\n\n# Float variable\ny = 3.14\n\n# String variable\nname = \"Alice\"\n```\n\n### Data Types\n\nPython has several built-in data types, such as integers, floats, and strings. Here is a list of common data types:\n\n- `int`: Integer type\n- `float`: Floating-point type\n- `str`: String type\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis tutorial provided an overview of basic Python concepts. To learn more, refer to the [official Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/).\n```",

Some of the key concepts in machine learning include supervised learning, unsupervised learning, neural networks, and reinforcement learning. \n\n### Supervised Learning\n\nSupervised learning involves training a model on a labeled dataset, which means that each training example is paired with an output label. The goal is to learn a mapping from inputs to outputs that can be used to make predictions on new, unseen data. Common algorithms include linear regression, logistic regression, and support vector machines.\n\n### Unsupervised Learning\n\nUnsupervised learning, on the other hand, deals with datasets that do not have labeled responses. The goal is to infer the natural structure present within a set of data points. Algorithms in this category include k-means clustering, hierarchical clustering, and association rules.\n\n### Neural Networks\n\nNeural networks are a set of algorithms, modeled loosely after the human brain, that are designed to recognize patterns. They interpret sensory data through a kind of machine perception, labeling, and clustering of raw input. Common applications include image and speech recognition.\n\n### Reinforcement Learning\n\nReinforcement learning is about taking suitable actions to maximize a particular reward in a particular situation. It is employed in various fields, such as game theory, control theory, operations research, information theory, and multi-agent systems.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nMachine Learning is a powerful tool that can be used to make predictions and decisions based on data. Its applications are vast and diverse, ranging from medical diagnosis to autonomous vehicles. Understanding the different types of machine learning algorithms and their applications can greatly enhance your ability to solve complex problems.\n```",

You will need to install a code editor such as Visual Studio Code or Atom.\n\n### Installation Instructions\n\n1. Download the installer from the official website.\n2. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.\n3. Open the code editor and familiarize yourself with its interface.\n\n## Variables\n\nIn programming, variables are used to store data that can be later used and modified. Here is an example in Python:\n\n```python\nx = 5\ny = \"Hello, World!\"\n```\n\nIn this example, `x` is a variable that stores the integer value `5`, and `y` is a variable that stores the string `\"Hello, World!\"`.\n\n## Control Structures\n\nControl structures allow you to control the flow of your program. The most common control structures are `if` statements, `for` loops, and `while` loops. Here\u2019s an example in Python:\n\n```python\nif x > 0:\n    print(\"x is positive\")\nelse:\n    print(\"x is not positive\")\n```\n\n## Functions\n\nFunctions are reusable blocks of code that perform a specific task. Here is an example of a function in Python:\n\n```python\ndef greet(name):\n    return f\"Hello, {name}!\"\n```\n\nYou can call this function like this:\n\n```python\nprint(greet(\"Alice\"))\n```\n\n## Data Structures\n\nData structures are used to store and organize data. The most common types are lists, dictionaries, and tuples. Here is an example of each in Python:\n\n```python\n# List\nfruits = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"]\n\n# Dictionary\nages = {\"Alice\": 25, \"Bob\": 30}\n\n# Tuple\ncoordinates = (10, 20)\n```\n\n## Conclusion\n\nCongratulations! You have completed the beginner's guide to programming. Keep practicing and experimenting with code to become a proficient programmer.\n```",

Smart contracts are programs that govern the behavior of the accounts within the Ethereum state. Solidity is a statically-typed programming language designed for developing smart contracts that run on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).\n\n### The Structure of a Solidity Source File\n\nThe structure of a Solidity source file is straightforward. Here\u2019s an example:\n\n```solidity\n// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT\npragma solidity ^0.8.0;\n\ncontract SimpleStorage {\n    uint storedData;\n\n    function set(uint x) public {\n        storedData = x;\n    }\n\n    function get() public view returns (uint) {\n        return storedData;\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Contract Layout\n\nA contract in Solidity is similar to a class in object-oriented languages. It contains state variables, functions, function modifiers, events, errors, and struct types. Contracts can also have constructors, as well as fallback and receive functions.\n\n### Language Features\n\nSolidity supports several fundamental programming concepts, including:\n\n- Static typing\n- Inheritance\n- Libraries\n- Complex data types and structures\n- Exception handling\n- Application Binary Interface (ABI)\n```",

Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation. \n\n## Features of Python\n\n1. **Easy to Read, Learn and Write**: Python is a high-level programming language that has an English-like syntax. This makes it easier to read and understand the code.\n2. **Dynamically Typed**: Python is dynamically-typed language, which means types are determined at runtime and you don't need to declare them explicitly.\n3. **Interpreted Language**: Python is an interpreted language, which means that the source code is executed line by line, which makes debugging easier.\n\n## Python Uses\n\n- **Web Development**: Frameworks such as Django and Flask are used for developing web applications.\n- **Data Science**: Libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib are used for data analysis and visualization.\n- **Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning**: Libraries such as TensorFlow and Keras are used for AI and ML projects.\n\n## Getting Started with Python\n\nTo start programming in Python, you'll need to have the Python interpreter installed on your machine. You can download it from the official [Python website](https://www.python.org/).\n\n```python\n# This is a simple Python program\nprint(\"Hello, World!\")\n```\n\nIn the above program, the `print` function outputs the string `\"Hello, World!\"` to the console.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nPython is a versatile language that can be used in various domains. Its simplicity and readability make it a great choice for beginners and experienced programmers alike.\n```",

Its design allows it to be converted to many output formats, but the original tool by the same name only supports HTML. Markdown is often used to format readme files, for writing messages in online discussion forums, and to create rich text using a plain text editor.\n\n## History\n\nMarkdown was created by John Gruber in 2004. The original goal was to enable people \"to write using an easy-to-read and easy-to-write plain text format, and optionally convert it to structurally valid HTML\". Many implementations of Markdown have been developed since Gruber's original specification.\n\n## Basic Syntax\n\nHere is a brief overview of the basic Markdown syntax:\n\n- **Headings**: Use `#` for H1, `##` for H2, `###` for H3, and so on.\n- **Bold**: Wrap your text with double asterisks `**bold**` or double underscores `__bold__`.\n- **Italic**: Wrap your text with single asterisk `*italic*` or single underscore `_italic_`.\n- **Blockquotes**: Use `>` to start a blockquote.\n- **Lists**: Create an unordered list with `-` or `*`. Create an ordered list with numbers followed by a period.\n- **Code**: Inline code with backticks `` `code` `` and code blocks with triple backticks.\n\n## Advanced Syntax\n\nMarkdown also supports advanced formatting options, including:\n\n- **Links**: `[Link text](URL)`\n- **Images**: `![Alt text](URL)`\n- **Tables**: \n\n```\nHeader 1 | Header 2\n---------|---------\nContent 1 | Content 2\n```\n\n- **Task Lists**: \n\n```\n- [x] Item 1\n- [ ] Item 2\n- [ ] Item 3\n```\n\n## Conclusion\n\nMarkdown is a powerful tool for creating formatted text documents. Its simplicity and flexibility make it ideal for a wide range of applications, from note-taking to web content creation. Whether you are a beginner or an experienced writer, mastering Markdown can greatly enhance your productivity.\n```",

In this guide, we'll explore the basics of machine learning and how it can be applied to real-world problems.\n\n# Table of Contents\n\n1. [What is Machine Learning?](#what-is-machine-learning)\n2.

[Reinforcement Learning](#reinforcement-learning)\n6. [Key Algorithms and Techniques](#key-algorithms-and-techniques)\n\n# What is Machine Learning?\n\nMachine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence that focuses on building systems that can learn from and make decisions based on data. Unlike traditional programming, where the programmer specifies explicit instructions, machine learning systems use data to learn patterns and make predictions.\n\n# Types of Machine Learning\n\nThere are three main types of machine learning: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. Each type of machine learning is suited to different types of tasks and problems.\n\n## Supervised Learning\n\nIn supervised learning, the system is trained on a labeled dataset, which means that each training example is paired with an output label. The goal is for the system to learn a mapping from inputs to outputs that it can use to make predictions on new, unseen data.\n\n## Unsupervised Learning\n\nUnsupervised learning involves training a system on data that does not have labeled outputs. The goal is to find hidden patterns or intrinsic structures in the input data. Common techniques include clustering and dimensionality reduction.\n\n## Reinforcement Learning\n\nIn reinforcement learning, the system learns by interacting with an environment. It receives feedback in the form of rewards or penalties and makes decisions to maximize the cumulative reward. This type of learning is often used in robotics, game playing, and other areas where decision-making is critical.\n\n# Key Algorithms and Techniques\n\nSome of the key algorithms and techniques used in machine learning include:\n\n- Linear Regression\n- Logistic Regression\n- Decision Trees\n- Random Forests\n- Support Vector Machines (SVM)\n- Neural Networks\n\nEach of these algorithms has its strengths and weaknesses and is suited to different types of tasks and data types.\n\n```",

This feature was introduced in ES6 and has gained popularity due to its concise syntax and ease of use.\n\n## Array Destructuring\n\nArray destructuring allows you to unpack values from arrays into individual variables. Here's a basic example:\n\n```javascript\nconst numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\nconst [first, second, third] = numbers;\n\nconsole.log(first); // Output: 1\nconsole.log(second); // Output: 2\nconsole.log(third); // Output: 3\n```\n\nIn this example, the values from the `numbers` array are destructured into the variables `first`, `second`, and `third`.\n\n## Object Destructuring\n\nObject destructuring allows you to unpack values from objects into individual variables. Here's an example:\n\n```javascript\nconst person = {\n    name: 'John Doe',\n    age: 30,\n    city: 'New York'\n};\nconst { name, age, city } = person;\n\nconsole.log(name); // Output: John Doe\nconsole.log(age); // Output: 30\nconsole.log(city); // Output: New York\n```\n\nIn this example, the values from the `person` object are destructured into the variables `name`, `age`, and `city`.\n\n## Default Values\n\nYou can also assign default values when destructuring arrays and objects. Here's an example:\n\n### Array Example\n\n```javascript\nconst numbers = [1, 2];\nconst [first, second, third = 3] = numbers;\n\nconsole.log(first); // Output: 1\nconsole.log(second); // Output: 2\nconsole.log(third); // Output: 3\n```\n\n### Object Example\n\n```javascript\nconst person = {\n    name: 'John Doe'\n};\nconst { name, age = 25, city = 'Unknown' } = person;\n\nconsole.log(name); // Output: John Doe\nconsole.log(age); // Output: 25\nconsole.log(city); // Output: Unknown\n```\n\nIn these examples, `third`, `age`, and `city` are given default values, which are used if the destructured value is `undefined`.\n```",

Over the past few years, I've had the opportunity to visit some incredible destinations, and I'd like to share a few of those experiences with you.\n\n## Italy: The Land of Art and History\n\nMy journey to Italy was nothing short of a dream come true. From the enchanting canals of Venice to the historical ruins of Rome, every moment was filled with awe. I still remember my first bite of authentic Italian pizza in Naples; it was a revelation.\n\n- **Venice:** The gondola rides through the narrow canals were both romantic and surreal.\n- **Rome:** The Colosseum and the Roman Forum took me back in time to the grandeur of ancient Rome.\n- **Florence:** As an art lover, visiting the Uffizi Gallery and seeing works by Michelangelo and Leonardo da Vinci was a highlight.\n\n![Venice](./images/venice.jpg)\n\n## Japan: A Blend of Tradition and Modernity\n\nJapan was a stark contrast to Italy but equally fascinating. The mixture of ancient traditions with cutting-edge technology is something unique to this country.\n\n- **Tokyo:** The bustling city life, with its neon lights and skyscrapers, was an exciting experience.\n- **Kyoto:** Visiting the serene temples and witnessing a traditional tea ceremony was profoundly moving.\n- **Hokkaido:** The natural beauty, especially during the cherry blossom season, left me speechless.\n\n![Tokyo](./images/tokyo.jpg)\n\n## Peru: Adventure in the Andes\n\nPeru offered a different kind of adventure, one that was more connected with nature. Hiking the Inca Trail to Machu Picchu was physically challenging but immensely rewarding.\n\n- **Cusco:** The historical capital of the Inca Empire, filled with charming streets and local markets.\n- **Machu Picchu:** The ruins of this ancient city are a testament to the ingenuity of the Inca civilization.\n- **Amazon Rainforest:** Exploring the rainforest and its incredible biodiversity was an unforgettable experience.\n\n![Machu Picchu](./images/machu_picchu.jpg)\n\n# Conclusion\n\nEach of these destinations has left an indelible mark on my heart. Traveling not only broadens one's horizons but also enriches the soul. I look forward to my next adventure and the new experiences it will bring.\n\n```\n",

It is a branch of artificial intelligence based on the idea that systems can learn from data, identify patterns, and make decisions with minimal human intervention.\n\n## Types of Machine Learning\n\n1. **Supervised Learning**: The algorithm is trained on a labeled dataset, which means that each training example is paired with an output label. Common used supervised learning methods are:\n    - Regression\n    - Classification\n\n2. **Unsupervised Learning**: The algorithm is given data without explicit instructions on what to do with it. Instead, it tries to find hidden patterns or intrinsic structures in the input data. Common used unsupervised learning methods are:\n    - Clustering\n    - Association\n\n3. **Reinforcement Learning**: The algorithm learns by interacting with its environment, typically through trial and error. Actions that result in favorable outcomes are reinforced. It is widely used in robotics, gaming, and navigation.\n```",

In JavaScript, there are three ways to declare a variable:\n\n1. `var`\n2. `let`\n3. `const`\n\n## Declaring a Variable\n\nTo declare a variable in JavaScript, use one of the variable declaration keywords followed by the name of the variable. For example:\n\n```javascript\nvar x;\nlet y;\nconst z = 5;\n```\n\n## Variable Scope\n\nJavaScript has function scope and block scope. `var` is function scoped, while `let` and `const` are block scoped. This means that `let` and `const` are only available within the block they are defined.\n\n## Variable Hoisting\n\nIn JavaScript, variable declarations (using `var`) are moved to the top of their scope before code execution. This is called hoisting. However, variables declared with `let` and `const` are not hoisted.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nUnderstanding how to properly declare variables and their scope is crucial to writing effective and bug-free JavaScript code.\n```",
