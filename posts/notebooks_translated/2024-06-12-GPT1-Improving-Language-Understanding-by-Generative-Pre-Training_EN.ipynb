Before reading the post you need to put yourself in situation, before GPT language models were based on recurrent networks (RNN), which were networks that worked relatively well for specific tasks, but with which you could not reuse the pre-training to make them a fine tuning for other tasks. In addition, they did not have much memory, so if you put very long sentences in them, they did not remember the beginning of the sentence very well."

In addition, when the model is evaluated on the supervised task, it is not only evaluated on that task, but on how well it predicts the next token, this helps to improve the generalization of the supervised model and makes the model converge faster.\n",
                        " * Although we have already mentioned it, the paper says that the transformer architecture is used, since up to that time RNNs were used for the language models. This resulted in an improvement in that what was learned in the first training (training on the unsupervised text corpus) is easier to transfer to supervised tasks. That is, thanks to the use of transformers, it was possible to train on a whole corpus of text and then fine-tune it in supervised tasks.\n",

They also analyze the \"zero-shot\" behaviors of the pre-trained model in four different environments and showed that it acquires useful linguistic knowledge for subsequent tasks.\n",

However, these approaches primarily transfer information at the word level, whereas the use of transformers trained on large unsupervised text corpora captures higher-level, sentence-level semantics."
