This collaboration allowed Neeva to integrate Karpenter with its Kubernetes dashboard, enabling the company to gather valuable metrics on usage and performance.\n",

To manage these costs effectively, the company adopted a combination of Amazon EC2 Spot Instances and On-Demand Instances. Spot Instances allow Neeva to bid on unused EC2 capacity, often at a fraction of the On-Demand price, while On-Demand Instances provide the necessary reliability for critical pipelines.\n",
