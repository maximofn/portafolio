  <markdown>Caffeine is a software to prevent our Linux from locking the screen and then going to sleep. To do this, we will give it caffeine.</markdown>
  <markdown>## Installation</markdown>
  <markdown>The installation is very simple, we just have to do

``` bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install caffeine
```
</markdown>
  <markdown>## Infinite Caffeine</markdown>
  <markdown>If we press the `windows` key on the keyboard and type `caffeine-indicator`, the option to start the software indicator will appear.

</markdown>
  <markdown>If we run it, a software indicator will appear in the top bar of Ubuntu

</markdown>
  <markdown>If we click on the indicator, a menu will appear.

  <markdown>Now we can click on `Activate` so that our Ubuntu will have infinite caffeine and never go to sleep.

  <markdown>## Caffeine for a Command</markdown>
  <markdown>One thing that happens to me is that when I train a neural network, I like to keep the model evaluation in view, even if I'm not at the computer. But if that training takes hours, at some point the screensaver activates and you can no longer see the training progress. So to fix this, we have `caffeinate`, which by doing

``` bash
`caffeinate` COMMAND
```

We will make our computer have caffeine and not fall asleep while running the command `COMMAND`
