  <markdown>With Fail2ban we can block IPs that try to connect to one of our devices. Here I will explain how to configure the blocking when they attempt to connect via SSH.</markdown>
  <markdown>## Installation</markdown>
  <markdown>The installation is very simple, we just have to do

``` bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install fail2ban
```
</markdown>
  <markdown>## Configuration file</markdown>
  <markdown>Once installed, we modify the configuration file by doing

``` bash
sudo nano /etc/fail2ban/jail.conf
```</markdown>
  <markdown>We go down to the part where it says `[sshd]`, in my case I left it like this

``` bash
[sshd]
bantime  = 172800
port     = ssh
logpath  = %(sshd_log)s
backend  = %(sshd_backend)s
maxretry = 3
```

What it does is that if someone makes 3 connection retries, it bans that IP for 48 hours (172800 seconds).
</markdown>
  <markdown>## Check the logs</markdown>
  <markdown>We can check through the logs if any IP has been blocked with

``` bash
cat /var/log/fail2ban.log
```</markdown>
