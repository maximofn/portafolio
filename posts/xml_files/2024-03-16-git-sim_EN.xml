  <markdown>Are you afraid to do a `git rebase`? Or a `git reset`? Or any other git command? Don't worry, because with `git-sim` you'll be able to see before you do it what's going to happen so you can make the right decision.</markdown>

## Installation

To install `git-sim` we first need to install `manim`, which is a python library for making animations. For this we can install it with pip:

```bash
pip install manim
```

or with conda

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge manim
```</markdown>
  <markdown>Once `manim` is installed we can install `git-sim` with pip:

```bash
pip install git-sim
```</markdown>
  <markdown>## Use</markdown>
  <markdown>Now that we have it installed we go to a repository and test any git command changing `git` for `git-sim`. For example, if in a repository of mine I do a `git-sim reset --hard HEAD~1` it will show me an animation of how the rebase would look like before doing it.

As we can see it is showing me that if I do `git reset --hard HEAD~1` it would go from commit `ae757a8` to commit `3754c64` and that it would also remove the changes in the files indicated in `Changes deleted from`.</markdown>
