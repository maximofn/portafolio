  <markdown>## Paper</markdown>
  <markdown>[Language Models are Unsupervised Multitask Learners](https://cdn.openai.com/better-language-models/language_models_are_unsupervised_multitask_learners.pdf) is the GPT-2 paper. This is the second version of the model [GPT-1](https://maximofn.com/gpt1/) that we have already seen.</markdown>
  <markdown>## Architecture</markdown>
  <markdown>Before discussing the architecture of GPT-2, let's recall how the architecture of GPT-1 was.

![gpt1 architecture](https://images.maximofn.com/GPT1_architecture.webp)
</markdown>
  <markdown>In GPT-2, a transformer-based architecture is used, just like in [GPT-1](https://maximofn.com/gpt1/), with the following sizes

|Parameters|Layers|d_model|
|---|---|---|
|117M| 12| 768|
| 345M| 24| 1024|| 762M| 36| 1280|
| 1542M| 48| 1600|

The smallest model is equivalent to the original GPT, and the second smallest is equivalent to the largest BERT model. The largest model has more than an order of magnitude more parameters than GPT.
</markdown>
  <markdown>In addition, the following modifications were made to the architecture

* A normalization layer is added before the attention block. This can help stabilize the model's training and improve its ability to learn deeper representations. By normalizing the inputs of each block, variability in the outputs is reduced and model training is facilitated.
* An additional normalization has been added after the final self-attention block. This can help reduce variability in the model's outputs and improve its stability.
* In most models, the weights of the layers are initialized randomly, following a normal or uniform distribution. However, in the case of GPT-2, the authors decided to use a modified initialization that takes into account the depth of the model. The idea behind this modified initialization is that as the model becomes deeper, the signal flowing through the residual layers tends to weaken. This is because each residual layer adds to the original input, which can cause the signal to attenuate with the depth of the model. To counteract this effect, they decided to scale the weights of the residual layers during initialization by a factor of 1/√N, where N is the number of residual layers. This means that as the model becomes deeper, the weights of the residual layers become smaller. This initialization trick can help stabilize the training of the model and improve its ability to learn deeper representations. By scaling the weights of the residual layers, variability in the outputs of each layer is reduced, and the flow of the signal through the model is facilitated. In summary, the modified initialization in GPT-2 is used to counteract the attenuation effect of the signal in the residual layers, which helps stabilize the training of the model and improve its ability to learn deeper representations.
* The vocabulary size has expanded to 50,257. This means that the model can learn to represent a wider set of words and tokens.
* The context size has been increased from 512 to 1024 tokens. This allows the model to take into account a broader context when generating text.

</markdown>
  <markdown>## Summary of the paper</markdown>
  <markdown>The most interesting ideas from the paper are:

* For the pre-training of the model, they considered using a diverse and almost unlimited source of text, such as web scraping from Common Crawl. However, they found that there was text of very poor quality. So they used the WebText dataset, which also came from web scraping but with a quality filter, such as the number of outbound links from Reddit, etc. They also removed text coming from Wikipedia, as it could be duplicated on other pages.* They used a BPE tokenizer that we already explained in a [post](https://maximofn.com/bpe/) previously
</markdown>
  <markdown>## Text Generation</markdown>
  <markdown>Let's see how to generate text with a pretrained GPT-2</markdown>
  <markdown>To generate text, we will use the model from the [GPT-2](https://huggingface.co/openai-community/gpt2) repository of Hugging Face.</markdown>
  <markdown>### Text Generation with Pipeline</markdown>
  <markdown>With this model, we can already use the transformers pipeline</markdown>
  <input_code>from transformers import pipeline

checkpoints = "openai-community/gpt2-xl"
generator = pipeline('text-generation', model=checkpoints)
output = generator("Hello, I'm a language model,", max_length=30, num_return_sequences=5)
for i, o in enumerate(output):
    print(f"Output {i+1}: {o['generated_text']}")</input_code>
  <output_code>Truncation was not explicitly activated but `max_length` is provided a specific value, please use `truncation=True` to explicitly truncate examples to max length. Defaulting to 'longest_first' truncation strategy. If you encode pairs of sequences (GLUE-style) with the tokenizer you can select this strategy more precisely by providing a specific strategy to `truncation`.
Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:50256 for open-end generation.
</output_code>
  <output_code>Output 1: Hello, I'm a language model, and I want to change the way you read

A little in today's post I want to talk about
Output 2: Hello, I'm a language model, with two roles: the language model and the lexicographer-semantics expert. The language models are going
Output 3: Hello, I'm a language model, and this is your brain. Here is your brain, and all this data that's stored in there, that
Output 4: Hello, I'm a language model, and I like to talk... I want to help you talk to your customers

Are you using language model
Output 5: Hello, I'm a language model, I'm gonna tell you about what type of language you're using. We all know a language like this,
</output_code>
  <markdown>### Text Generation with Automodel</markdown>
  <markdown>But if we want to use `Automodel`, we can do the following</markdown>
  <input_code>import torch
from transformers import GPT2Tokenizer, AutoTokenizer

checkpoints = "openai-community/gpt2-xl"
tokenizer = GPT2Tokenizer.from_pretrained(checkpoints)
auto_tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(checkpoints)</input_code>
  <markdown>Just like with [GPT-1](https://maximofn.com/gpt1/#Text-generation) we can import `GPT2Tokenizer` and `AutoTokenizer`. This is because in the GPT-2 [model card](https://huggingface.co/openai-community/gpt2) it is indicated that `GPT2Tokenizer` should be used, but in the post about the [transformers](https://maximofn.com/hugging-face-transformers/) library we explain that `AutoTokenizer` should be used to load the tokenizer. So let's try both.</markdown>
  <input_code>checkpoints = "openai-community/gpt2-xl"
tokenizer = GPT2Tokenizer.from_pretrained(checkpoints)
auto_tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(checkpoints)

input_tokens = tokenizer("Hello, I'm a language model,", return_tensors="pt")
input_auto_tokens = auto_tokenizer("Hello, I'm a language model,", return_tensors="pt")

print(f"input tokens: \n{input_tokens}")
print(f"input auto tokens: \n{input_auto_tokens}")</input_code>
  <output_code>input tokens: 
{'input_ids': tensor([[15496,    11,   314,  1101,   257,  3303,  2746,    11]]), 'attention_mask': tensor([[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]])}
input auto tokens: 
{'input_ids': tensor([[15496,    11,   314,  1101,   257,  3303,  2746,    11]]), 'attention_mask': tensor([[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]])}
</output_code>
  <markdown>As can be seen with the two tokenizers, the same tokens are obtained. So, to make the code more general, so that if the checkpoints change, the code doesn't have to be changed, we will use `AutoTokenizer`</markdown>
  <markdown>We then create the device, the tokenizer, and the model</markdown>
  <input_code>import torch
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, GPT2LMHeadModel

device = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")

checkpoints = "openai-community/gpt2-xl"
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(checkpoints)
model = GPT2LMHeadModel.from_pretrained(checkpoints).to(device)</input_code>
  <markdown>Now that we have instantiated the model, let's see how many parameters it has</markdown>
  <input_code>params = sum(p.numel() for p in model.parameters())
print(f"Number of parameters: {round(params/1e6)}M")</input_code>
  <output_code>Number of parameters: 1558M
</output_code>
  <markdown>As we can see, we have loaded the model with 1.5B parameters, but if we wanted to load the other models, we would have to do</markdown>
  <input_code>checkpoints_small = "openai-community/gpt2"
model_small = GPT2LMHeadModel.from_pretrained(checkpoints_small)
print(f"Number of parameters of small model: {round(sum(p.numel() for p in model_small.parameters())/1e6)}M")

checkpoints_medium = "openai-community/gpt2-medium"
model_medium = GPT2LMHeadModel.from_pretrained(checkpoints_medium)
print(f"Number of parameters of medium model: {round(sum(p.numel() for p in model_medium.parameters())/1e6)}M")

checkpoints_large = "openai-community/gpt2-large"
model_large = GPT2LMHeadModel.from_pretrained(checkpoints_large)
print(f"Number of parameters of large model: {round(sum(p.numel() for p in model_large.parameters())/1e6)}M")

checkpoints_xl = "openai-community/gpt2-xl"
model_xl = GPT2LMHeadModel.from_pretrained(checkpoints_xl)
print(f"Number of parameters of xl model: {round(sum(p.numel() for p in model_xl.parameters())/1e6)}M")</input_code>
  <output_code>Number of parameters of small model: 124M
Number of parameters of medium model: 355M
Number of parameters of large model: 774M
Number of parameters of xl model: 1558M
</output_code>
  <markdown>We create the input tokens for the model</markdown>
  <input_code>input_sentence = "Hello, I'm a language model,"
input_tokens = tokenizer(input_sentence, return_tensors="pt").to(device)

input_tokens</input_code>
  <output_code>{'input_ids': tensor([[15496,    11,   314,  1101,   257,  3303,  2746,    11]],
       device='cuda:0'), 'attention_mask': tensor([[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]], device='cuda:0')}</output_code>
  <markdown>We pass it to the model to generate the output tokens</markdown>
  <input_code>output_tokens = model.generate(**input_tokens)

print(f"output tokens: \n{output_tokens}")</input_code>
  <output_code>Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:50256 for open-end generation.

  <markdown>#### Greedy search</markdown>
  <markdown>We have used `model.generate` to generate the output tokens all at once, but let's see how to generate them one by one. For this, instead of using `model.generate`, we will use `model`, which actually calls the `model.forward` method.</markdown>

  <markdown>We see that it outputs a lot of data, let's first look at the keys of the output.</markdown>
  <input_code>outputs.keys()</input_code>
  <output_code>odict_keys(['logits', 'past_key_values'])</output_code>
  <markdown>In this case we only have the logits of the model, let's check their size</markdown>
  <input_code>logits = outputs.logits

logits.shape</input_code>
  <output_code>torch.Size([1, 8, 50257])</output_code>
  <markdown>Let's see how many tokens we had at the input</markdown>
  <input_code>input_tokens.input_ids.shape</input_code>
  <output_code>torch.Size([1, 8])</output_code>
  <markdown>Well, at the output we have the same number of logits as at the input. This is normal.</markdown>
  <markdown>We obtain the logits from the last position of the output</markdown>
  <input_code>nex_token_logits = logits[0,-1]

nex_token_logits.shape</input_code>
  <output_code>torch.Size([50257])</output_code>
  <markdown>There is a total of 50257 logits, meaning there is a vocabulary of 50257 tokens and we need to determine which token has the highest probability. To do this, we first calculate the softmax.</markdown>
  <input_code>softmax_logits = torch.softmax(nex_token_logits, dim=0)

softmax_logits.shape</input_code>
  <output_code>torch.Size([50257])</output_code>
  <markdown>Once we have calculated the softmax, we obtain the most likely token by finding the one with the highest probability, that is, the one with the highest value after the softmax.</markdown>
  <input_code>next_token_prob, next_token_id = torch.max(softmax_logits, dim=0)

next_token_prob, next_token_id</input_code>
  <output_code>(tensor(0.1732, device='cuda:0', grad_fn=&lt;MaxBackward0&gt;),
 tensor(290, device='cuda:0'))</output_code>
  <markdown>We have obtained the following token, now we decode it</markdown>
  <input_code>tokenizer.decode(next_token_id.item())</input_code>
  <output_code>' and'</output_code>
  <markdown>We obtained the following token using the greedy method, that is, the token with the highest probability. But we already saw in the post about the transformers library the [ways to generate text](https://maximofn.com/hugging-face-transformers/#Formas-de-generación-de-texto) that can be done `sampling`, `top-k`, `top-p`, etc.</markdown>
  <markdown>Let's put everything into a function and see what comes out if we generate a few tokens</markdown>
  <input_code>def generate_next_greedy_token(input_sentence, tokenizer, model, device):
    input_tokens = tokenizer(input_sentence, return_tensors="pt").to(device)
    outputs = model(**input_tokens)
    logits = outputs.logits
    nex_token_logits = logits[0,-1]
    softmax_logits = torch.softmax(nex_token_logits, dim=0)
    next_token_prob, next_token_id = torch.max(softmax_logits, dim=0)
    return next_token_prob, next_token_id</input_code>
  <input_code>def generate_greedy_text(input_sentence, tokenizer, model, device, max_length=20):
    generated_text = input_sentence
    for _ in range(max_length):
        next_token_prob, next_token_id = generate_next_greedy_token(generated_text, tokenizer, model, device)
        generated_text += tokenizer.decode(next_token_id.item())
    return generated_text</input_code>
  <markdown>Now we generate text</markdown>
  <input_code>generate_greedy_text("Hello, I'm a language model,", tokenizer, model, device)</input_code>
  <output_code>"Hello, I'm a language model, and I'm going to help you with your problem.\n\n\nI'm going to help you"</output_code>
  <markdown>The output is quite repetitive as was already seen in the [ways of generating texts](https://maximofn.com/hugging-face-transformers/#Formas-de-generaci%C3%B3n-de-texto). However, it is still a better output than what we obtained with [GPT-1](https://maximofn.com/gpt1/#Generaci%C3%B3n-de-texto)</markdown>
  <markdown>## Architecture of the models available in Hugging Face</markdown>
  <markdown>If we go to the Hugging Face documentation for [GPT2](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/model_doc/gpt2) we can see that we have the options `GPT2Model`, `GPT2LMHeadModel`, `GPT2ForSequenceClassification`, `GPT2ForQuestionAnswering`, `GPT2ForTokenClassification`. Let's take a look at them.</markdown>
  <input_code>import torch

ckeckpoints = "openai-community/gpt2"</input_code>
  <markdown>### GPT2Model</markdown>
  <markdown>This is the base model, that is, the transformer decoder.</markdown>
  <input_code>from transformers import GPT2Model
model = GPT2Model.from_pretrained(ckeckpoints)
model</input_code>
  <output_code>GPT2Model(
  (wte): Embedding(50257, 768)
  (wpe): Embedding(1024, 768)
  (drop): Dropout(p=0.1, inplace=False)
  (h): ModuleList(
    (0-11): 12 x GPT2Block(
      (ln_1): LayerNorm((768,), eps=1e-05, elementwise_affine=True)
      (attn): GPT2Attention(
        (c_attn): Conv1D()
        (c_proj): Conv1D()
        (attn_dropout): Dropout(p=0.1, inplace=False)
        (resid_dropout): Dropout(p=0.1, inplace=False)
      )
      (ln_2): LayerNorm((768,), eps=1e-05, elementwise_affine=True)
      (mlp): GPT2MLP(
        (c_fc): Conv1D()
        (c_proj): Conv1D()
        (act): NewGELUActivation()
        (dropout): Dropout(p=0.1, inplace=False)
      )
    )
  )
  (ln_f): LayerNorm((768,), eps=1e-05, elementwise_affine=True)
)</output_code>
  <markdown>As can be seen from the output, a tensor of dimension 768, which is the dimension of the embeddings for the small model. If we had used the model `openai-community/gpt2-xl`, we would have obtained an output of 1600.

Depending on the task you want to perform, you would now need to add more layers.

We can add them manually, but the weights of those layers would be initialized randomly. Whereas if we use Hugging Face models with these layers, the weights are pretrained.
</markdown>
  <markdown>### GPT2LMHeadModel</markdown>
  <markdown>It is the one we used before to generate text</markdown>
  <input_code>from transformers import GPT2LMHeadModel
model = GPT2LMHeadModel.from_pretrained(ckeckpoints)
model</input_code>
  <output_code>GPT2LMHeadModel(
  (transformer): GPT2Model(
    (wte): Embedding(50257, 768)
    (wpe): Embedding(1024, 768)
    (drop): Dropout(p=0.1, inplace=False)
    (h): ModuleList(
      (0-11): 12 x GPT2Block(
        (ln_1): LayerNorm((768,), eps=1e-05, elementwise_affine=True)
        (attn): GPT2Attention(
          (c_attn): Conv1D()
          (c_proj): Conv1D()
          (attn_dropout): Dropout(p=0.1, inplace=False)
          (resid_dropout): Dropout(p=0.1, inplace=False)
        )
        (ln_2): LayerNorm((768,), eps=1e-05, elementwise_affine=True)
        (mlp): GPT2MLP(
          (c_fc): Conv1D()
          (c_proj): Conv1D()
          (act): NewGELUActivation()
          (dropout): Dropout(p=0.1, inplace=False)
        )
      )
    )
    (ln_f): LayerNorm((768,), eps=1e-05, elementwise_affine=True)
  )
  (lm_head): Linear(in_features=768, out_features=50257, bias=False)
)</output_code>
  <markdown>As can be seen, it is the same model as before, only at the end a linear layer has been added with an input of 768 (the embeddings) and an output of 50257, which corresponds to the vocabulary size.</markdown>
  <markdown>### GPT2ForSequenceClassification</markdown>
  <markdown>This option is for classifying text sequences, in this case we have to specify with `num_labels` the number of classes we want to classify.</markdown>
  <input_code>from transformers import GPT2ForSequenceClassification
model = GPT2ForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(ckeckpoints, num_labels=5)

  <markdown>We can see that we get `loss=None`</markdown>
  <input_code>print(outputs.loss)</input_code>
  <output_code>None
</output_code>
  <markdown>Since we will need the loss to perform fine-tuning, let's see how to obtain it.

If we go to the documentation of the [forward](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/gpt2#transformers.GPT2LMHeadModel.forward) method of `GPT2LMHeadModel`, we can see that it states that the output is an object of type `transformers.modeling_outputs.CausalLMOutputWithCrossAttentions`. So, if we go to the documentation of [transformers.modeling_outputs.CausalLMOutputWithCrossAttentions](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/main_classes/output#transformers.modeling_outputs.CausalLMOutputWithCrossAttentions), we can see that it states that it returns `loss` if `labels` are passed to the `forward` method.

If we go to the source code of the [forward](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/main/src/transformers/models/gpt2/modeling_gpt2.py#L1277) method, we see this block of code

```python
loss = None
if labels is not None:
# move labels to correct device to enable model parallelism
labels = labels.to(lm_logits.device)
# Shift so that tokens &lt; n predict n
shift_logits = lm_logits[..., :-1, :].contiguous()
shift_labels = labels[..., 1:].contiguous()
# Flatten the tokens
loss_fct = CrossEntropyLoss()
loss = loss_fct(shift_logits.view(-1, shift_logits.size(-1)), shift_labels.view(-1))
```
That is, the `loss` is calculated as follows

* Logits and labels shift: The first part is to shift the logits (`lm_logits`) and the labels (`labels`) so that the `tokens &lt; n` predict `n`, meaning from position `n` it predicts the next token based on the previous ones.
* CrossEntropyLoss: An instance of the loss function `CrossEntropyLoss()` is created.
* Flatten tokens: Next, the logits and labels are flattened using `view(-1, shift_logits.size(-1))` and `view(-1)`, respectively. This is done to ensure that the logits and labels have the same shape for the loss function.
* Calculation of the loss: Finally, the loss is calculated using the `CrossEntropyLoss()` function with the flattened logits and flattened labels as inputs.

In summary, the `loss` is calculated as the cross-entropy loss between the shifted and flattened logits and the shifted and flattened labels.

Therefore, if we pass the labels to the `forward` method, it will return the `loss`.

  <markdown>### Fine tuning GPT-2 for sentence classification</markdown>
  <markdown>Now we are going to do a training with the Hugging Face libraries</markdown>
  <markdown>#### Dataset</markdown>
  <markdown>We are going to use the `imdb` dataset for sentiment classification into positive and negative.</markdown>
  <input_code>from datasets import load_dataset

dataset = load_dataset("imdb")
dataset</input_code>
  <output_code>DatasetDict({
    train: Dataset({
        features: ['text', 'label'],
        num_rows: 25000
    })
    test: Dataset({
        features: ['text', 'label'],
        num_rows: 25000
    })
    unsupervised: Dataset({
        features: ['text', 'label'],
        num_rows: 50000
    })
})</output_code>
  <markdown>Let's take a look at it a bit</markdown>
  <input_code>dataset["train"].info</input_code>
  <output_code>DatasetInfo(description='', citation='', homepage='', license='', features={'text': Value(dtype='string', id=None), 'label': ClassLabel(names=['neg', 'pos'], id=None)}, post_processed=None, supervised_keys=None, task_templates=None, builder_name='parquet', dataset_name='imdb', config_name='plain_text', version=0.0.0, splits={'train': SplitInfo(name='train', num_bytes=33435948, num_examples=25000, shard_lengths=None, dataset_name='imdb'), 'test': SplitInfo(name='test', num_bytes=32653810, num_examples=25000, shard_lengths=None, dataset_name='imdb'), 'unsupervised': SplitInfo(name='unsupervised', num_bytes=67113044, num_examples=50000, shard_lengths=None, dataset_name='imdb')}, download_checksums={'hf://datasets/imdb@e6281661ce1c48d982bc483cf8a173c1bbeb5d31/plain_text/train-00000-of-00001.parquet': {'num_bytes': 20979968, 'checksum': None}, 'hf://datasets/imdb@e6281661ce1c48d982bc483cf8a173c1bbeb5d31/plain_text/test-00000-of-00001.parquet': {'num_bytes': 20470363, 'checksum': None}, 'hf://datasets/imdb@e6281661ce1c48d982bc483cf8a173c1bbeb5d31/plain_text/unsupervised-00000-of-00001.parquet': {'num_bytes': 41996509, 'checksum': None}}, download_size=83446840, post_processing_size=None, dataset_size=133202802, size_in_bytes=216649642)</output_code>
  <markdown>Let's take a look at the features this dataset has.</markdown>
  <input_code>dataset["train"].info.features</input_code>
  <output_code>{'text': Value(dtype='string', id=None),
 'label': ClassLabel(names=['neg', 'pos'], id=None)}</output_code>
  <markdown>The dataset contains strings and classes. Additionally, there are two types of classes, `pos` and `neg`. We will create a variable with the number of classes.</markdown>
  <input_code>num_clases = len(dataset["train"].unique("label"))
num_clases</input_code>
  <output_code>2</output_code>
  <markdown>#### Tokenizer</markdown>
  <markdown>We create the tokenizer</markdown>
  <input_code>from transformers import GPT2Tokenizer

checkpoints = "openai-community/gpt2"
tokenizer = GPT2Tokenizer.from_pretrained(checkpoints, bos_token='&lt;|startoftext|&gt;', eos_token='&lt;|endoftext|&gt;', pad_token='&lt;|pad|&gt;')
tokenizer.pad_token = tokenizer.eos_token</input_code>
  <markdown>Now that we have a tokenizer, we can tokenize the dataset, since the model only understands tokens.</markdown>
  <input_code>def tokenize_function(examples):
    return tokenizer(examples["text"], padding="max_length", truncation=True)

tokenized_datasets = dataset.map(tokenize_function, batched=True)</input_code>
  <markdown>#### Model</markdown>
  <markdown>We instantiate the model</markdown>
  <input_code>from transformers import GPT2ForSequenceClassification

model = GPT2ForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(checkpoints, num_labels=num_clases).half()
model.config.pad_token_id = model.config.eos_token_id</input_code>
  <output_code>Some weights of GPT2ForSequenceClassification were not initialized from the model checkpoint at openai-community/gpt2 and are newly initialized: ['score.weight']
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.
</output_code>
  <markdown>#### Evaluation</markdown>
  <markdown>We create an evaluation metric</markdown>
  <input_code>import numpy as np
import evaluate

metric = evaluate.load("accuracy")

def compute_metrics(eval_pred):
    logits, labels = eval_pred
    predictions = np.argmax(logits, axis=-1)
    return metric.compute(predictions=predictions, references=labels)</input_code>
  <markdown>#### Trainer</markdown>
  <markdown>We create the trainer</markdown>
  <input_code>from transformers import Trainer, TrainingArguments

training_args = TrainingArguments(
    output_dir="./results",
    learning_rate=2e-5,
    per_device_train_batch_size=16,
    per_device_eval_batch_size=64,
    num_train_epochs=3,
    weight_decay=0.01,
)

trainer = Trainer(
    model=model,
    args=training_args,
    train_dataset=tokenized_datasets["train"],
    eval_dataset=tokenized_datasets["test"],
    compute_metrics=compute_metrics,
)</input_code>
  <markdown>#### Training</markdown>
  <markdown>We train</markdown>
  <input_code>trainer.train()</input_code>
  <output_code>&lt;IPython.core.display.HTML object&gt;</output_code>
  <output_code>TrainOutput(global_step=4689, training_loss=0.04045845954294626, metrics={'train_runtime': 5271.3532, 'train_samples_per_second': 14.228, 'train_steps_per_second': 0.89, 'total_flos': 3.91945125888e+16, 'train_loss': 0.04045845954294626, 'epoch': 3.0})</output_code>
  <markdown>#### Inference</markdown>
  <markdown>We test the model after training it.</markdown>
  <input_code>import torch

device = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")

def get_sentiment(sentence):
    inputs = tokenizer(sentence, return_tensors="pt").to(device)
    outputs = model(**inputs)
    prediction = outputs.logits.argmax(-1).item()
    return "positive" if prediction == 1 else "negative"</input_code>
